msl,Normal,Yes,"Non-linear. The scatter plot shows that the highest precipitation occurs within a mid-range of pressure values (approx. 100500-101250), not at the extremes.","The distribution is approximately normal. Its relationship with precipitation is not a simple line, but confined to a specific pressure band."
sst,Bimodal,No,"No clear relationship. Precipitation events are scattered within the two main temperature clusters, but there is no obvious trend.",This feature has a bimodal distribution. It does not appear to be a strong individual predictor for the amount of precipitation.
u10,Normal,Yes,"Weak positive relationship. The plot is very scattered, but higher precipitation is possible as the eastward wind component moves away from zero.",The eastward wind component follows a normal distribution with many outliers. Its relationship with precipitation is noisy.
v10,Normal,Yes,Very weak relationship. The points are widely scattered with no discernible pattern connecting the northward wind component to precipitation amount.,Normally distributed with many outliers. It appears to be a poor predictor of precipitation on its own.
ws,Skewed Right,Yes,"Weak positive relationship. Higher wind speeds allow for higher precipitation, but the relationship is very scattered (heteroscedastic).","Wind speed is positively skewed. Higher wind speeds are associated with a greater *possibility* of rain, but not a certainty."
t2m,Skewed Left,Yes,Non-linear. The highest precipitation values are concentrated in a specific temperature band (approx. 24-27Â°C).,"Temperature is slightly skewed left. Its relationship with rain is not linear; instead, there's an optimal temperature range for heavy precipitation."
rh,Skewed Left,Yes,"Strong, non-linear positive relationship. There is a clear threshold around 75% RH, above which precipitation becomes possible and increases dramatically.","Relative humidity is strongly skewed left. It is the most telling predictor, showing that high humidity is a necessary condition for rain."
tp,Skewed Right,Yes,,"Total precipitation is extremely skewed to the right, which is typical for rainfall data where non-rainy days (value 0) are most common."
