Based on all the plots, several key patterns emerge. The correlation heatmap initially highlighted the strongest linear relationships: a significant negative correlation between 2m temperature (t2m) and relative humidity (rh) at -0.60, and a strong positive one between wind speed (ws) and the eastward wind component (u10) at +0.64. However, the scatter plots provide crucial context. The relationship between total precipitation (tp) and relative humidity (rh) is visually the most important; it's a strong, non-linear relationship where precipitation is virtually zero until rh crosses a threshold of about 75%, after which the potential for heavy rain increases sharply. This confirms rh as a key predictor. Furthermore, the scatter plots for tp versus t2m and tp versus msl explain their low linear correlation values: the relationships are non-linear, with the heaviest precipitation occurring within specific "optimal" bands of temperature and pressure, not at the extremes. The wind components (u10, v10) show very diffuse relationships with precipitation, suggesting that while overall wind speed might play a role, wind direction alone is not a strong predictor of rainfall amount.
