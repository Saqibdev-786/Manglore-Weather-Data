### Strong correlations, noticeable or interesting patterns

#### 1. Strongest linear relationships (from the heatmap):

A significant negative correlation exists between 2m air temperature (t2m) and relative humidity (rh) at approximately -0.60, reflecting the well-known physical relationship that warmer air holds more moisture and thus tends to have lower relative humidity.

A strong positive correlation is seen between wind speed (ws) and the eastward wind component (u10) at about +0.64, which is expected since ws is derived from u10 and v10.

#### 2. Target variable tp (precipitation) and predictors:

The relationship between precipitation and relative humidity (rh) is visually the most important. Precipitation is almost absent until rh crosses a threshold of around 75%, after which the likelihood and magnitude of rainfall increase sharply. This makes rh the most critical predictor in the dataset.

Both temperature (t2m) and mean sea level pressure (msl) show non-linear relationships with precipitation. The heaviest rainfall is concentrated within specific “optimal” bands (approx. t2m 24–27 °C, msl 100500–101250 Pa), rather than at extreme values.

Sea surface temperature (sst) exhibits a bimodal distribution but does not show a clear direct relationship with precipitation in the scatter plots.

#### 3. Wind components:

The individual components (u10 and v10) show diffuse scatterplots against precipitation, suggesting that wind direction alone has little predictive power for rainfall intensity.

However, overall wind speed (ws) may play a role: higher values are associated with a greater possibility of rainfall, but the relationship is weak and highly scattered (heteroscedastic).
